An unofficial KOReader plugin to download and read works hosted on Archive Of Our Own, mainly just a personal project since it was something I wanted so it's really messy.
The plugins menu is found under the search tab in the top menu on the second page only while the filemanager is open.

## Features
- Browse and download from AO3 by either a singular tag or a detailed filter
- Download works by there id
- Update and delete downloaded works from the download menu
- Open downloaded works via the plugins menu to automatically track read chapters and open works at certain chapters

## Features I want to work on
- Support using a AO3 account
- Commenting and giving kudos to works right from the plugin
- View all the works by a certain author
- Show tag bookmarks in the filter tag search menus
- Search by tags by both tapping on them in the fanfic browser menu and tapping the tags link within the epub itself
