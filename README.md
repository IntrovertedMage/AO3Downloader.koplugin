An unofficial KOReader plugin to download and read works hosted on Archive Of Our Own, mainly just a personal project since it was something I wanted so it's really messy.
The plugins menu is found under the search tab in the top menu on the second page only while the filemanager is open.

## Features
- Browse and download from AO3 by either a singular tag or a detailed filter
- Download works by their id
- Update and delete downloaded works from the download menu
- Open downloaded works via the plugins menu to automatically track read chapters and open works at certain chapters
- Search for and open users profiles and download the users works, series, bookmarks and gifted works.
  - Profiles can also be open from the work search results menu by tapping the author category

## Features I want to work on
- ~~Support using a AO3 account~~ - done 
- ~~Commenting and giving kudos to works right from the plugin~~ - done
- ~~View all the works by a certain author~~ - done
- Show tag bookmarks in the filter tag search menus
- Search by tags by both tapping on them in the fanfic browser menu and tapping the tags link within the epub itself
- Open a new search for works containing a certain tag by tapping the tags link in an open fanfic file
- Open up a users profile by tapping on the users link in an open fanfic file
- Improve downloaded works menu
- View and manage series, user and works subscriptions when logged in
- Option to use cookies as alternative login method
